# @jonnyboats/calendar-react

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 83b0eba: Week / Day / Custom time-grid (CAL2 v2-a + v2-b, AVS §4–§6) — the hour-grid views. Built in the
  locked order (Week+Day first, Custom as the parameterization). Contract additive only.

  - **core:** `packDayColumn` — the collision Defined Equivalent (§6): strict-overlap clusters,
    greedy lowest-free-column = peak concurrency, fixed equal-width (no expand-to-fill, deliberate
    divergence S3-1); min-block-height is render-only (`blockBox`), never feeds collision.
    `dayLengthMinutes`/`minutesSinceMidnight`/`nowLineFraction` — DST-correct (real 1380/1440/1500
    day length). `dayColumnSegments` (single-day + cross-midnight clamped, excludes all-day /
    ongoing / >24h-timed), `packStrip` (all-day bars + multi-day ribbons + ongoing band + per-column
    "+N more"), `alignWeekStart`/`rangeDays`. Property + fuzz: no same-column overlap, columnCount =
    peak concurrency, deterministic, no NaN/negative geometry.
  - **react:** `TimeGridCalendar` (flat mount API) + `TimeGridSkin` — generic over N columns so Day =
    Week-with-one-column and Custom = N columns. All-day strip + hour grid + collision blocks +
    DST now-line (today only) + cross-midnight blocks in both days + ongoing band (clickable focus
    stop) + "+N more" strip expansion + default scroll precedence (now-line → earliest → 7 AM, §4.2).
    Linear-focus a11y (§7.3: column headers + items in DOM order, Arrow L/R between columns, NOT 2-D
    roving), axe-clean. Custom: prev/next by exactly N days (contiguous), `x`/`4` live in v2.
  - **contract:** additive optional `CalendarConfig` `customViewDays` (2–7, default 4), `minBlockPx`
    (default 22), `weekScrollAnchorHour` (0–23, default 7).

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- a343d80: Schedule / Agenda view (CAL2 v1-a, AVS §2) — the mobile-default, forward-from-now
  chronological list. First of the additional views; contract seam unchanged (additive only).

  - **core:** headless `buildAgenda` flattens a fetched window into a pinned "Happening now /
    Ongoing" list (§2.1a — multi-day/ongoing started before the window), the in-window keyset
    stream, and a past list. `pageForward`/`pageEarlier` paginate by a composite keyset cursor
    `(start, occurrenceId)` (§2.3) with property-tested no-dup/no-drop across fat-date
    boundaries; `groupByDay` buckets in `displayTimeZone` (§1.3). `AgendaItem.ongoing` flags
    the "Ongoing through {date}" rows.
  - **react:** `ScheduleCalendar` (flat-prop mount API) + `ScheduleSkin`. Date-group headers,
    rows (dot · time · title · location), pinned section, "Today — no events" anchor (S2-6),
    reveal-by-page + "Load earlier events" (`includePast`), responsive row-click (popover
    desktop / navigate mobile, §2.2), reused detail popover + `.ics`, client-side legend
    filter, loading/empty/error states, and list a11y (role=list, Tab/Arrow rows, Esc returns
    focus, axe-clean).
  - **contract:** additive optional `CalendarConfig` fields `agendaPageSize` (default 25) and
    `scheduleRowAction` (`"responsive" | "popover" | "navigate"`, default `"responsive"`).

- 3be448e: Year view (CAL2 v1-b, AVS §3) — 12 mini-months over a cheap per-day per-category presence
  map. Reuses Month's day-cell grid + day popover. Contract unchanged.

  - **core:** `buildPresence(events, cfg, year)` → `{ "2026-03-14": ["craft-fair","music"] }`
    (dates + category labels, NO payloads); `presentDays(map, hidden)` recomputes dotted days
    client-side so the legend filter honors RS §6 "every view" (review S1-2). A multi-day /
    ongoing occurrence dots every day it spans (§1.5). `presenceCategories` for the legend.
  - **react:** `YearCalendar` (flat-prop mount API) + `YearSkin`. 12 mini-months, one presence
    dot per dotted day (deliberate divergence from Google's multi-dot, §3.1), today-disc,
    hydrate-on-click → day popover (§3.2), undotted-day → "No events on {date}" popover,
    month-title → Month, prev/next year + Today, grid-of-grids a11y (per-month title + roving
    grid, 24 tab stops, §7.2), axe-clean. Shared `occurrencesOnDay` extracted for reuse.

### Patch Changes

  - @jonnyboats/calendar-core@1.1.0

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Ongoing strip now renders a human-readable through-date ("Dec 19, 2026") instead of the raw ISO
  date ("2026-12-19"). Surfaced by the live MMATF integration.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Verify the OIDC Trusted Publishing release pipeline (no functional change).

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 1.0.0 — frozen seam + host-embeddable Month.

  The `CalendarEvent` contract is declared stable: any future change is a major bump (enforced by
  `guard:changeset`). `@jonnyboats/calendar-react` adds the host-facing **`MonthCalendar`** mount API
  (flat props, theme tokens, render slots, navigation/filter callbacks), ships as a proper client
  component (`"use client"` baked into the package entry) for host Next.js App Router / OpenNext
  embedding, and re-exports the contract validators. `CalendarMonth` is kept as a deprecated alias.

### Minor Changes

- 448b817: v0 walking skeleton: the SemVer-frozen `CalendarEvent` contract + Zod validators, the headless
  Month engine (span resolution, ongoing rule, lane-packing + ribbon×overflow, a11y state model,
  `.ics`), and the React Month skin. See `docs/` for the full scope; Week/Day/Year/Schedule, the
  web component, and the MCP server are committed but fenced off until after v0.
